# 2D Matrix Rotation

## Objective
This is a utility class that can rotate a two-dimensional matrix both clockwise and counterclockwise. The initial idea is based on a challenge on HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-rotation-algo/problem) but I extended it a little bit so that it considers the direction of the rotation as well.

Basically, You are given a 2D matrix, of dimension MxN and a positive integer R. You have to rotate the matrix R times and print the resultant matrix.

## Tests
A thorough test data set, guarantees the correctness of the solution and also simplifies the future refactorings.
To run the tests, you need PHPUnit7 to be installed first. Then run the following command:
`phpunit`

## Notes
This is PHP7-compliant
